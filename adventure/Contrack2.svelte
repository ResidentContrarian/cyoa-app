<p>OK, got it. Now, do you think lying is wrong because it either <i>has a tendency to make you worse, in terms of your value as a person</i> or indicates that you <i>are worse, in terms of your value as a person, than some hypothetical perfect person?</i> That lying isn't wrong as such, but instead is a potentially neutral action that really, really top-notch people don't do?
