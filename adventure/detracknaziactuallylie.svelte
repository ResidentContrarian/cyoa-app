	<Link to=detractconfork>At some point, the consequences of a morally correction action outweigh the rightness or wrongness of the action. In this case, people were going to die; I think my action wasn't wrong considering that.</Link>
	<Link to=scalesofgood>The action of lying is wrong, and no amount of consequences can nullify that. But lying here seems like it would break some higher-order rules; I think "thou shalt not lie" just got outranked here.</Link>
	<Link to=detracksometimesyousin>Actually, it's neither. I think that lying is morally wrong in this case, I just couldn't face the music of living up to my moral ideals.</Link>
