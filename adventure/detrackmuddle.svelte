<h2>Ugh. You are a complex thing that has a big enough range I'm not going to try to name it or dig any deeper.</h2>

<p>So despite the "Ugh", I'm not judging you. It's just that doing your category justice involves a lot of work I don't want to do. The thing about you is that depending on how many exceptions you have, you range from something like "A person who thinks lying isn't wrong when it saves a life, and perhaps a few other similarly serious situations" to "Confused consequentialist".
</p>
<p>Figuring out what you are exactly would take time. Time we don't have. And it wouldn't really be worth it because basically all we are doing is counting the number of exceptions to the rule here. Again, it's not that this is especially bad in any way, it's just that I have to write a bunch of these entries and get this published before people start complaining about me being inconsistent again.
</p>
<p>Your funny coded category name is MUDDLESTUMP.
