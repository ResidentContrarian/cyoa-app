<h2>You are a Long-Termist Dishonesty Prepper Consequentialist.</h2>

<p>You think most people only get one big shot at joining the big show. You are like Eminem in eight mile, waiting for you big break. Training. Meditating. Growing. The big difference is that you aren't going to rap at the opportunity so much as you are going to lie at it.
</p>
<p>Like a person shooting random passers-by from his balcony to dull his emotions in anticipation of an expected eventual <i>Red Dawn</i> situation, you are trading more certainty of benefit now for black-swan sort of payout at the end of the road. Like a boyscout, you are ready; unlike a boyscout... well, you get it.
</p>

<p>Your funny coded category name is OLIEMPIAN.
