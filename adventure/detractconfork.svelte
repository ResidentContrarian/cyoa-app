<p>Listen, man. To the extent there's defined sides of this quiz, you are essentially on the deontology side. That's supposed to be the easy side for me to write! Here you come, being all weird about it, and now you probably want me to branch off into like ninety different forks to capture whatever weird quibble you have about this. I have a tree outside that has branch problems; this guy from church named Hector helped me cut off some of it but he's telling me I need to hire an arborist or something to make sure I don't lose the tree.
</p>
<p>
You think I want MORE branch problems, even if they are in this test? Nope.

	In the first page of this, I asked if you thought lying was absolutely wrong, and in the last page I gave you two ways to resolve your whole thing that didn't threaten that absolutism. Then you told me you think things are wrong conditioned on their consequences!
</p>
<p>
	I'm kicking you out of the deontology side of the test. You have been banished to consequentialism. And so help me, if I hear so much as another word, I'm sending you to the Labyrinth of a myriad myriad words. This is a place where meaning is eschewed in favor suffering, a place where letters are assembled as if by diabolists bent on creating an exitless hell of mastubatory prose, a place where there is nothing to be learned and the only escape is death.
