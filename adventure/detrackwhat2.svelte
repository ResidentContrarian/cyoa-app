	Wow, OK, got it.

	As previously noted, the assumption here is that this is the worst-case scenario; by saying it's wrong to lie here, you are saying it's wrong to lie in any stand-alone situation whatsoever. But that's what you believe is right or wrong, not what you'd actually do.
</p>
<p>
	Taking as a given that you think it would be wrong to lie here, what do you think you'd actually do in this situation?

<Exits>
	<Link to=detracknaziactuallytelltruth>I'd tell the truth. A lie is a lie, and it's wrong to lie.</Link>
	<Link to=detracknaziactuallylie>I think I'd actually probably lie here.</Link>
