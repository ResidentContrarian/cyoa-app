<p>OK, so imagine you are at a party, and James, a gross person, is asking you why the host didn't invite him to the party and he had to find out about it by seeing a bouncy castle as he drove by in his smelly, terrible car. James is the worst. Everyone knows it. You know it, the host knows it, the flies know it.
</p>
<p>Regardless of what you do and don't tell him, how are you making that decision?

	<Link to=virself>I'm trying to figure out what the best version of myself would do. Like, I have a certain version of myself I hope to someday be, and I look for the action that works towards making me that person.</Link>
	<Link to=verhero>I imagine a heroically good person, real or hypothetical and then try to imagine what they'd do, and do that.</Link>
	<Link to=verminism>I try to think of what would be best for James - to nurture him, to help him to grow, and to get him to bathe.</Link>
