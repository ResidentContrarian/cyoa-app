<h2>You are a full-stop anti-lying absolutist.</h2>

<p>When you were a kid, your parents took you to see <i>Space Jam</i> and as you left the theater a lie shot them both dead. Using the extensive Veritas family fortune, you trained your body, mind, and soul for revenge.  
</p>
<p>The point of this branch was to set up a scenario where a lie was as justified as possible. Life-and-limb were at stake and the person being lied to was both terrible and deserved it (if anyone does). But for you there are no gray areas, just one very bright line you won't cross. The only way to get you to lie is to perhaps trap you in a logical overflow error like an evil computer from <i>Star Trek</i>.
</p>
<p>This isn't completely fair, but you are one of the few categories who I assumed lied to get here. The claim here is pretty close to "I never lie". "Not lying at all" is actually pretty tough compared to "Not lying much", so I tend to hear claims that one never ever lies with a skeptical, suspicious ear.</p>
<p>Your funny coded category name is FUANLYAB.
