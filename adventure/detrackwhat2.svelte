	Wow, OK, got it. 
</p>
<p>
	As previously noted, the assumption here is that this is the worst-case scenario; by saying it's wrong to lie here, you are saying it's wrong to lie in any stand-alone situation whatsoever. But that still leaves cofactors outside of the stand-alone situation. So now imagine this: At a previous date, the father of the Jewish family asked you NOT to reveal their location, and you said you wouldn't. Telling the Nazi would thus retroactively make that statement a lie.   
</p>
<p>
	Still wrong?
</p>
<p>

<Exits>
	<Link to=detracknazialwayswrong>That's true, but this would be wrong just as my previous lie to the Jewish father is now wrong; you still shouldn't lie to the Nazi.</Link>
	<Link to=detracknazikindalesswrong>It's wrong to lie to the Nazi, and wrong to lie to the Father, but it's <i>less wrong</i> to lie because the two lies are balancing each other, or something.</Link>
