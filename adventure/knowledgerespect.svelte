<h2>Your are a Laissez-Faire Omniscient Consequentionalist.</h2>

<p>You care about consequences, and only consequences. You know all outcomes, and only all outcomes. Where people say they prefer to know the truth you respect that, outcomes be damned.
</p>
<p>As in some other cases, I don't actually believe you can predict the future. Probably neither do you. As stated elsewhere, though, this is just a good thought problem category so I'm leaving it in. I sometimes wonder if some people aren't mentally editing "and this is a knowable thing you can know" to the end of the "The good of an act is determined by its consequences" short description of consequentialism. I don't know if they are or aren't, but I know it's the first stop on strawman-tour you take when you go after utilitarians and the like. 
</p>
<p>Your funny coded category name is SLEEPYSAURON.
