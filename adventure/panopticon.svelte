<h2>You are an Eye-of-The-Beholder Virtue Ethicist.</h2>

<p>I forced an internet friend into beta testing this whole thing, and she mentioned that she was unsatisfied with the virtue ethics track. I asked why, and she gave me an answer that I'm already almost completely sure has morphed into something different in my head: Basically, she probably said, she's more worried about her perception in the eyes of others than she her own perception of herself. 
</p>
<p>There's a way to squint your eyes and put that into almost any system. If you are worried about how God perceives you, that might make you a divine command theory deontologist. If that doesn't do it for you, you can push to the other extreme and say that the way people perceive you is just one of many consequences your actions carry.
</p>
<p>I think it's actually more appropriate here in the virtue ethics section, mostly because it's here that it's the most interesting. Virtue ethics basically demands that you think of a hypothetical role model that is well respected, lauded, and loved; someone that has not only survived life but who has sort of kicked its ass. Then you do what you think that person would do. And that seems reasonable! It's pretty fuzzy around the edges, but in all honesty most of us never even really get the hang of the "be a pretty nice person" beginners course most moral systems offer. Fuzzy works, if it's an effective kind of fuzzy.
</p>
<p>But consider this: with every single variant of every moral system, it's pretty easy to accuse people of doing things for the wrong reasons. Consequentialists accuse deontologists of hiding behind rules the jerry-rig in their own favor. Deontologists accuse consequentialists of pretending they do this complex moral math for every decision they make while mostly just doing what they wanted to do anyway.</p>
<p>If you were going after virtue ethicists, the easy target is the self-centeredness of the system - you do things you want to do, based on an idealized version of yourself. But in this modified system, you add in an external judgment process - you are not so much concerned with what you think of you as living a life that makes others think well of you.</p>
<p>Anybody who reads my stuff knows that I'm not part of this system, but I think just as I'd probably be a Sihk if I wasn't a Christian, I'd probably be this if I wasn't a divine command theory deontologist. There are worse ways to go than living your life wholly in a way that tries to maximize how valuable others find you. If nothing else, you wouldn't expect to die alone.</p>
