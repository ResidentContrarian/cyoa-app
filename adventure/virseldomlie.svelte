<h2>You are a Ideal-Seeking Anti-Lie Realist.</h2>

<p>Basically you don't think lying is wrong so much as you think that people who lie aren't living their best lives or being the best people they could be. As opposed to more absolutist versions of this general view on honesty, you don't think that this is universal; as opposed to more lax versions, you still think that lying is generally bad even if there's exceptions. Sometimes, you feel, a lie could be good if the situation called for it. But if you find that it calls for it a lot, you would introspect; after all, is the ideal person a known habitual liar?
</p>
<p>There's a passage of the Bible (the book of James) that talks a bit about how works don't grant Christian salvation, but the kind of Faith that does grant access to salvation has other implications, one of which is motivating works. Your approach to lying is sort of like that; you don't care about lying that much, but you do care about being a really top-notch guy. If it turns out that really top-notch guys don't lie a lot (and you don't think they do), that motivates you to lie less without actually convincing you that lies are the problem. 
</p>
<p>I can hear you saying something like "this whole section is really lame and non-specific!", but I assure you that's not my fault. It turns out the whole field of virtue ethics is basically something like "good people do things that good people do!", where "good" is defined in a way much closer to <i>successful and satisfied</i>. Essentially it asks you to imagine what you want people to say at your funeral, and work backwards from there. Whether you do this by imagining an idealized version of yourself or by following in the footsteps of an impressive rolemodel Wenceslas-style is mostly left up to you.

<p>Most of this description is going to be copied to a few other variants on this theme with some minor tweaks. Don't be peeved at me.
