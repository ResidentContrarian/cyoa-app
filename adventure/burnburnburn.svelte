<h2>You are a Kindof Crazy A-Hole.</h2>

<p>Alternate title: Negative-Outcome Maximizing Logical Consequentialist.
</p>
<p>When they were passing out definitions of <i>Good Consequences</i>, you said "No thanks - brought my own.". You consider others something like bacteria that need to be sterilized away with dishonesty, and then put the "lie" in "Human-Grade Lysol" and get to work. </p>
<p>I suspect that outside of mental illness, not many people like you actually exist in a thought-out-and-intentional way. I think it's more likely in one-off situations, i.e. a lie intended to screw over one particular guy or one particular group of people. I only know of one person who superficially appears to have lied on a long timescale with the thought of "let's kill as many people in my outgroup as possible", and any names used in this article are very likely to be unrelated to him.
