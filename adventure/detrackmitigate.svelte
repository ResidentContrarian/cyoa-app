<p> So, if you got here, you are very likely working up to saying a particular thing related to the definition of the word "lie" itself. If what I say after this doesn't track with what you were thinking, go back and try an different option; I should have most of them covered in one way or another.
</p>
<p>The way I understand this stance is something like this: We don't usually consider someone who kills someone else in self-defense to be a murderer. It's <i>killing,</i> yes, but not murder; the situation is different enough that we need a different word to cover them. And usually the same is true of things like, say, killing a mass-murdering Nazi in defense of innocents, or stuff like that.
</p>
<p>If this semantic flexibility applies to killing, it should probably apply to things like lying, too; if anything it's a lower-impact way to get the whole "save a life" thing done than applying lethal force on the aggressor. Since in some cases we accept that there's a difference between murder and killing, might just it open up the possibility of saying "lying is always a sin, but this isn't lying really; we just don't have a good term for lying in self-defense".
</p>
<p>Two questions for you:
</p>
<ol><li>Is that close to what you were thinking?</li><li>Is this true just with situations we'd normally think of as self-defense, or other things as well?</li></ol>

<Exits>
	<Link to=detracklifelimb>Yes, that's what I meant. I don't think there are any other exceptions.</Link>
	<Link to=detrackmuddle>Yes, that's about what I mean, but I can think of other exceptions that make lies into not-lies.</Link>
	<Link to=detrackwhynot>This isn't what I meant. Take me back a page.</Link>
</Exits>
