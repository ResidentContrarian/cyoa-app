	<Link to=oliempics2>Yeah, like, the deal is you said directly stemming from that lie. And yes, that can be interpreted to mean basically anything that happens in the future at all. But in terms of what I could reasonably track off this lie, it might be a net negative at least in terms of what I could see. But what if there was a "big score" on the way, so to speak? I want to keep sharp. I don't want my deceptive capacities dulled by infrequent use. I want to be ready for that one big lie that changes the world.</Link>
