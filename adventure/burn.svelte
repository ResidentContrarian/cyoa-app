<p>You are trying to make... bad consequences? Anti-Utility?

<Exits>
	<Link to=burnburnburn>Yes. I mean, look at those weak-ass utilitarians, with their "most good for the most people" weirdness. You know what EA stands for? Extremely annoying. I'm stronger than that. I understand. Consequences? I'll show them Consequences. I'll show them consequences like those weaklings never, ever imagined. When the fires my lies have lit rise up to consume this ruined world, I will laugh. The peals of my laughter will usher in the <i>barren age.</i></Link>
