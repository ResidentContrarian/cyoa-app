<p>OK, you chose one of the weird tracks. What happens from here is at least partially your own fault. 
</p>
<p>Imagine you hear a knock at your door, and you open it up to find your stoop occupied by a group of Izans, which are backwards Nazis. They want to tell them where a nearby fugitive group of Jews are, so they can take them to their futuristic utopian city and help them thrive while enjoying perfect freedom and friendship. This is good timing, because there's actual Nazis in the neighborhood; if you don't tell the Izans where the family is hiding, the Nazis will probably get to them first and kill them. 
</p>
<p>Do you...
</p>
<p>You know what? No. This is dumb. Not because of your morality system but because this is going to be exactly the same as the deontology track. You can just go <Link to=detrack>here</Link> and palette-swap everything to fit your weird pro-lying deontology preference, and I save four hours.
</p>
<p>I understand that this might make you feel shortchanged, so:
</p>

<h2>You are a Madlibs Honesty Obstructionist.</h2>

<p>In a super-wacky way, you have taken out all the names of other value system's virtues, replaced them with underscores, and are now sitting in a TGI Fridays wondering how best to <i>rock your parent's comic world</i> before the appetizers are served.</p>

<p>Unless you are a confused consequentialist who just thinks lying consistently produces good outcomes, you are a sort of a dark-link version of everyone else. If you are a virtue ethicist, you just think being a liar is a good state; if you are a deontologist, you probably are in some Loki-based religion or something.</p>

<p>Your funny coded category name is MALIHOOBS.
